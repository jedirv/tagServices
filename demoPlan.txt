DEMO PREP
1.Michael will prepare two documents - one excel and one word

2.Michael will send (at least) five emails to Davos Stark.  Two of the emails will relate to one of the projects tags. One email will have an excel file attached that will need to be returned later.  The other one will have the word file that I save during the demo

3. Michael will specify four tags, something along the lines of:
    projects/keysite
    projects/ppaml
    osu
    shopping
    
4. Jed will open each email, which will call 
    backend.addEmail  (using entryID for now)
    backend.addPerson  (which will noop if person exists)
    
5. foreach email, Jed will create the relevant single tag, which will 
    backend.addTag 
    backend.tagEmail
    backend.tagPerson
    copy the tag into MailItems.category field 
    
6. for the email with an excel attachment, after tags have been associated, Jed will save that attachment
    backend.addResource
    backend.tagResource
    
7. actionable email will contain a word file attachment and say something like:
    "here's the report draft.  update it and send back with updated excel file"
