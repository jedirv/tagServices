Here's my detailed write up of today's discussion:

DEMO PREP
open email calls addEmail, addPerson
create tag for email calls addTag, tagEmail, tagPerson,copy the tag into MailItems.category field
    
save attachment calls addResource, tagResource

DEMO PLAN
show tags and files associated or not
show document want to attach via tag in reply window

tag->documents->(worddocname)->attach adds attachment directly to the reply message (rather than via file browser)

tag->documents->(exceldocname)->attach adds attachment directly to the reply message (rather than via file browser)
