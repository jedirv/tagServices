PART 1

This is what Outlook 2016 looks like - simlar to previous versions

TagBar - place where all tag related operations happen.  

drop down list on the right holds existing tags

Create Tag widget on the left

In the middle is a tag that is already associated with the current email message

the tag is synchronized with the native outlook categories feature

can use the tag list to add other tags to the email (show, then delete)

can untag an email by clicking the red X

as we select different emails, we see tags associated if any



PART 2

We're going to go through a particular use case, first how it's done 
normally, and then how we can do it with tag support

Normal way:
    read the email
    save off the email using attachment SaveAs
    open new explorer
    navigate to downloads\keysiteDemo folder
    double click on file to open word doc
    change word doc
    save it
    
    go to outlook and click reply
    click attach file
    navigate to keysite demo folder and select
    but then need other file, so 
    click attach file
    navitage to C:\Users\sudo\Documents\davos\  and add KeysiteCandidateExperience.xlsx
    now ready to send
    
    
    CLICK ON MESSAGE 2 NOT MESSAGE 1  OR DON'T CLICK ON MESSAGE
    
    
Now let's try with tags
    tag->attachments->save and open
    change the word doc
    save it
    
    go to outlook and click reply
    now right click on tag shows documents associated with tag
    can add both files this way without browsing
    
    in the future we will be able to do the following from within Word, after changing the document
        tag->send document as reply
             which will initiate a reply in outlook, and attach the document.  
        then, once we go back to outlook, we can add the other file via the attachment.
